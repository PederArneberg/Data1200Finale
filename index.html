            <p>
                We were looking forward to beginning at OsloMet! And we were quite excited about learning new stuff,
                and getting in the field of coding, calculating, programming and ofcourse meeting our fellow students!
                None of us had a lot of experience within the field from before.

                After the first couple of weeks, we understood that coding was a lot of fun! All the endless
                possibilities
                both within Java and HTML/CSS, we felt one could have control over how programs work and how one could
                build
                awesome websides. But we also discovered that a tiny misspelling of a word or simply a colon could ruin
                everything!
                We spent a lot of time just looking for a mistake, without finding it at all!

            <p>
                Luckely, after the first couple of times with frustration, there was a bit of releif! We were given help
                from TA's
                and we were surposed to do assigments in small groups. And as we descoved sometimes it's just a
                semicolon
                holding you back, and then it's nice to have more then one set of eyes looking through the code.
