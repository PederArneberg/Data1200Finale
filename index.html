            <p>
                We were looking forward to beginning at OsloMet! And we were quite excited about learning new stuff,
                and getting in the field of coding, calculating, programming and ofcourse meeting our fellow students!
                None of us had a lot of experience within the field from before.

                <h2>The first frustration</h2>

            <p>
            After the first couple of weeks, we understood that coding was a lot of fun! All the endless possibilities
            both within Java and HTML/CSS, we felt one could have control over how programs work and how one could build
            awesome websides. But we also discovered that a tiny misspelling of a word or simply a colon could ruin everything!
            We spent a lot of time just looking for a mistake, without finding it at all!

                <h2>A helping hand</h2>

            <p>
            Luckely, after the first couple of times with frustration, there was a bit of releif! We were given help from TA's
            and we were surposed to do assigments in small groups. And as we descoved sometimes it's just a semicolon 
            holding you back, and then it's nice to have more then one set of eyes looking through the code.
