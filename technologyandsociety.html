                One of the given obligatory assignments inspired us
                to talk about the topic of tracking. The Norwegian app Smittestopp came up in
                discussion. More specifically we started talking about our own experience with
                this application.
            </p>

                Smittestopp is an app meant to limit the spread of coronavirus in Norway.
                The app uses Bluetooth technology to share “ID-keys” among phones that are
                near each other. These keys are used to notify users of the app if they have
                been in contact with a user infected with coronavirus (Norwegian Institute
                of Public Health, 2021) (<a href="https://www.helsenorge.no/en/smittestopp/"target="_blank">Helsenorge</a> )

                There has been some controversy about the app because the first version was launched with a low regard to privacy
                and security. In a
                <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2020/04/02/advarer-mot-a-installere-fhis-korona-app/" target="_blank">article from NRK,</a> 
                lawyer and expert in privacy Jon Wessel-Aas said “I would not really recommend anyone to use the app as it is now. 
                Unfortunately”.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it turns out most of us still didn’t use the app. We asked ourselves
                why and it seems, for most of the group members the app still had some
                negative connotations. We concluded this is probably because of the large amount
                of critique

                the first version of the app received. After public outcry a second version
                was launched in which these issues were resolved.
                This second version was even launched with an open-source codebase. <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2020/ny-smittestopp-lansert/" target="_blank">Go to article about the new app</a>
