"The prevalence of this is increased by the inclusion of outline:0 in many CSS reset files, such as Eric Meyer’s CSS Reset. It applies outline:0 to all page elements. While he clearly indicates that focus styles should be re-implemented,…

/* remember to define focus styles! */
:focus {
outline: 0;
}

… the inclusion of outline:0 in the default code does not provide anything useful. This recommendation is almost always either misunderstood or ignored as evidenced by the many sites that use this code as is. Simply changing the focus code to outline:1px would result in better accessibility and understanding."
