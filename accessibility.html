        <h2>Our thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        Our main goal with the page, was to make an easily accessible webpage. To ensure this, we used different tools to
        get a better understanding on how a webpage becomes accessible to most people. We used WAVE a lot to scan the webpage to make
        sure the contrast and structure was satisfying <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">(wave webpage).</a>
        One of the things we had in mind when thinking about asseccibility, was to navigate the page by keybord. 
        And while navigating around we found that the focus was to invisible, so we made the focus outline-width 
        and outline-offset lager. 

                When it comes to links we tried to give every link a short and precise name. We also made every extern link
                open in a new window. Except from the ones linking around our own page, like the ones in the nav bar.
                We ran our code in the W3C html validator <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"
                    target="_blank">validator</a>
                and found that, even after working with the img tag, there were still some problems. We fixed the issue W3C
                suggested
                in the index page. We wanted the pictures to load acording to the users internet speed, and the
                size of the screen.
                We used all the atributes for this in the index page, but please notice that the pictures on the other
                pages may varies
                from this structure. For example on this page we have some small example off our code, and these
                pictures are not ment to
                be in any high resolution but is ment to be small illustrations.

            <h2>Essential to some - nice for everyone</h2>

            <p>For people with disabilities it's essential that a webpage is accesible to them, but it's not only
                beneficial for some,
                it makes the web more easy to acces and navigate for everbody.
