            <h2>Our thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Our main goal with the page, was to make a easily accessible webpage. To ensure that, we used
                different tools to
                help us understand how a webpage become accessible to most people. We used WAVE a lot to scan the
                webpage to make
                sure the contrast and structure were satisfying (<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">wave
                    webpage</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things we had in mind when thinking about asseccibility, was to navigate the page by keybord.
                And while navigating around we found that the focus was to invisible, so we made the focus outline-width
                and outline-offset lager. Here an example off a before and after the focus was chanced.
            </p>

            <img src="Img/without-focus.png" alt="Before the focus was changed">
            <img src="Img/with-focus.png" alt="After the focus was changed">

            <p>
                When it comes to links we tried to give every link a short and precise name. We also made every extern
                link
                open in a new window. Except from the ones linking around our own page, like the ones in the nav bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ran our code in the W3C html<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"> validator</a>
                and found that, even after working with the img tag, there were still some problems. We fixed the issues W3C
                suggested in the index page.
            </p> 
            <p>
                We wanted the pictures to load according to the users internet speed, and the
                size of the screen.
                We used all the attributes for this in the index page, but please notice that the pictures on the other
                pages may vary
                from this structure. For example on this page we have some small example off our code, and these
                pictures are not ment to
                be in any high resolution but is ment to be small and just for illustration.

            <h2>Essential to some - nice for everyone</h2>

            <p>
                When we first started to study the different kinds of accessibility and what they needed from a webpage,
                we also discovered that a lot of these changes would benefit everybody. For example with the pictures, we made
                the different sizes to fit different screen sizes, but it will also help if the user's loading the page from a 
                slow internet connection. Aswell with the links, first we created them with a screenreader in mind, but it also
                make the text more coherent to read for everybody.
