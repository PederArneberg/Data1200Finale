        <h2>Our thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        Our main goal with the page, was to make a easily accessible webpage. To ensure this, we used different tools to
        get a better understanding on how a webpage become accessible to most people. We used WAVE a lot to scan the webpage to make
        sure the contrast and structure was satisfying<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">(wave webpage).</a>
        One of the things we had in mind when thinking about asseccibility, was to navigate the page by keybord. 
        And while navigating around we found that the focus was to invisible, so we made the focus outline-width 
        and outline-offset lager. 

        When it comes to links we tried to give every link a short and precise name. We also made every link
        open in a new window except from the ones linking around out own page, like the ones in the nav bar.

        <h2>Essential to some - nice for everyone</h2>
        
        <p>For people with disabilities it's essential that a webpage is accesible to them, but it's not only beneficial for some,
            it makes the web more easy to acces and navigate for everbody.
